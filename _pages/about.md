I am a final-year undergraduate at Turing class, Peking university. I major in computer science and minor in mathematics. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Di He](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/dihe/) and [Prof. Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com/). I worked as an intern in [Prof. Cho-Jui Hsieh](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/)'s group at UCLA remotely in 2021.

My research area is machine learning, with special interests in models and algorithms inspired by theoretical insights. Recently, my work focuses on neural-network-based PDE solvers and the Transformer.

I will join CMU as a PhD student this fall!
