I am a junior student at Turing class, Peking university, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com/). I work closely with and learn a lot from [Di He](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/dihe/) at MSRA. 

My research area is machine learning, with special interests in models and algorithms inspired by theoretical insights. Recently, my work focuses on the Transformer and its variants [1]. I'm also interested in Transformers in vision and graph tasks.

[1] **Stable, Fast and Accurate: Kernelized Attention with Relative Positional Encoding** (NeruIPS 2021)

We propose a new method to accelerate attention calculation for Transformers with relative positional encoding (RPE) on top of the kernelized attention by utilizing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our method also helps to stablize training of kernelized attention models.
