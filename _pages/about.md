I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Machine Learning Department, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Prof. Yiming Yang](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./yiming/). I received my Bachelor's degree in computer science from Peking university where I was advised by [Prof. Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com/) and [Prof. Di He](https://dihe-pku.github.io/). I also worked as an intern with [Prof. Cho-Jui Hsieh](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/)'s group at UCLA remotely in 2021, and with [Dr. Srinadh Bhojanapalli](https://bsrinadh.github.io/) at Google in 2023.

My research area is deep learning. Recently, I'm working on algorithmic reasoning with Transformers and GNNs. I'm also interested in principled understanding and efficient scaling of large language models.

My detailed CV can be found [here](https://lithiumda.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
